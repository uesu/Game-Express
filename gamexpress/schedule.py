"""Version-schedule announcements: detect → extract → merge → post once → keep the card accurate.

Posting only happens on a keyword/pattern match (special program / special broadcast /
livestream announcement, or an official update-maintenance notice) — never daily.

Accuracy rules:
  * official posts (HoYoLAB / official X / Kuro) and config/overrides.json always win;
    countdown and learned-cadence fallbacks are visibly labelled estimated.
  * unknown values render as TBA; banners always carry (STC).
  * one card per game+version; later official info (maintenance notice, pre-install,
    banner notice, overrides edits) EDITS the same message silently (no re-ping).

    This is a fan-out, not a Discord "follow": the copy is rebuilt from the same data and is

    a schedule card is a living document (TBA banners fill in, guessed maintenance times are
    replaced by the official notice), so a copy that were only posted once would sit in
    #zzz-news showing estimates forever, which is worse than having no copy at all.

    The copy is built with an empty `Ping()` on purpose, and that is the one way it differs
    from the original. The role has already been mentioned in the schedule channel; mentioning
    it again here would notify every member TWICE for one announcement. An empty Ping also
    removes the mention *text*, so the copy does not render a dead blue @role pill that
    notifies nobody — it just reads as a clean card.

    The copy is strictly a convenience, so every failure is reported and swallowed: a broken
    game-channel webhook must never stop the real card in the schedule channel from being
    posted or kept up to date, and must never fail the run. `mirror_hash` is tracked
    separately from `payload_hash` for the same reason — a copy that failed to update retries
    on the next run without dragging the primary card back through an edit it already made.
